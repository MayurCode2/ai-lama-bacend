## Models

In this project, we use models to represent and interact with data in our database. Models define the structure of documents in a particular collection and provide an interface to interact with the database.

- **User Model**: Represents user data.
- **Project Model**: Represents project data.
- **Config Model**: Represents configuration data.

For more details, check the respective model files in the `src/models` directory.

## Controllers

Controllers handle the application's logic. They receive input from the user, process it through the models, and return a result to the user. Each controller corresponds to a specific route or endpoint.

- **UserController**: Manages user registration and authentication.
- **ProjectController**: Handles CRUD operations for projects.
- **ConfigController**: Manages configuration settings.

For more details, check the respective controller files in the `src/controllers` directory.

## Middleware

Middlewares are functions that have access to the request, response, and the next function in the applicationâ€™s request-response cycle. They can perform tasks such as authentication, validation, logging, etc.

- **Authenticate Middleware**: Ensures that requests are made by authenticated users.
- **Logger Middleware**: Logs information about incoming requests.

For more details, check the respective middleware files in the `src/middleware` directory.
